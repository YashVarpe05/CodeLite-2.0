    <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6">
      <li>Sign up for a Colosseum account. Once logged in, you'll have access to Colosseum's Find a Cofounder directory, product forums, and the Eternal dashboard.</li>
      <li>Click the "Start Challenge" button within the Eternal dashboard to initiate the 4 week development sprint. Submissions will be due through the portal at the end of the 4th week.</li>
      <li>At the end of each week during the sprint, builders will also need to submit a brief update that includes a video recording explaining what they prioritized that week.</li>
      <li>On the last week of the sprint, builders will need to submit the same materials requested at the end of our hackathons. This includes a product name, short product description, team background, the product GitHub repo (if closed source you'll need to grant Colosseum access privately), a pitch video presentation (under 3 minutes long), a technical video demo (under 3 minutes as well), and anything else that is critical to understanding the vision for your product.</li>
      <li>Eternal submissions will be reviewed on a first come first serve basis by the Colosseum team initially. We may reach out to you to schedule an interview call to learn more about your product submission and to meet the team.</li>
      <li>Throughout each quarter, a shortlist of products will be evaluated by the judging panel. The small panel consists of previous hackathon winners, leading Solana ecosystem founders, and the Colosseum team.</li>
      <li>The Eternal Award will be awarded to the team who the judging panel deems to be best positioned to push the entire Solana ecosystem forward. Again, this prize will be awarded on a semi-annual basis in-between our 2 primary hackathons.</li>
      <li>Founders will be notified of rejection or accelerator acceptance/pre-seed funding offers within 14 days of submission.</li>

        <li>Founder + Market Fit: Who is the team creating this product? Does the team have the right skillset and experience to succeed in the market they're entering? Why are they interested in creating a solution to the problem they set out to solve?</li>
        <li>Insight: Does the founding team have some unique insight based on their deep understanding of the problem space? Is there a new technology, or a new trend that creates an opportunity for their startup to succeed?</li>
        <li>Product + Execution: How well does the product work? How does it stack up against the competition? How quickly is the team shipping product updates and addressing user feedback?</li>
        <li>Potential Market Size: How big is the total addressable market for this project? Is it already large, or small but growing rapidly? What will be the impact of this project on the growth rate of their market?</li>
        <li>Founder Communication: Are the founders clearly communicating the product vision and capable of growing their product's userbase?</li>
        <li>Viability: Is there a scalable and sustainable business to be built around this project? At its core, Eternal is a startup competition, so this is critical. Make sure to allocate enough time on your presentation to give a holistic view of your startup.</li>

We run global hackathons twice per year, as well as our perpetual challenge called <a class="text-green-1 hover:brightness-150" target="_blank" href="/eternal">Eternal</a>.

If you're considering building a crypto startup, our hackathons provide the perfect opportunity to showcase what you can build while competing against other elite builders.

Colosseum hackathons are different from traditional hackathons that you may have participated in. 

The competitions are intended for serious developers and entrepreneurs to compete over a five-week period for a chance to receive pre-seed funding from Colosseum's venture fund, and to be admitted into Colosseum’s accelerator program.`,

If you are part of a team, each individual team member must sign up for a Colosseum account to register, and the team leader must add them to the project during the project submission process.

The project submission portal will go live on the Colosseum platform one week before the hackathon end date. In order to be eligible for any prizes and admittance into our accelerator program, team leaders must complete the project submission before the deadline.

        answer: `First and foremost, keep in mind that Colosseum hackathons are startup competitions. After projects are submitted, they are evaluated through multiple rounds of judging to determine a shortlist based on a review of all submitted materials. Even though Colosseum hackathons are intended to be a speed run through the technical development of a new product, it's important that all participants spend time refining their marketing and presentation, as well as their code.

All projects will be reviewed, and judges will consult these factors as they evaluate:
<ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6">
<li>Founder + Market Fit: Who is the team creating this product? Does the team have the right skillset and experience to succeed in the market they're entering? Why are they interested in creating a solution to the problem they set out to solve?</li>
<li>Insight: Does the founding team have some unique insight based on their deep understanding of the problem space? Is there a new technology, or a new trend that creates an opportunity for their startup to succeed?</li>
<li>Product + Execution: How well does the product work? How does it stack up against the competition? How quickly is the team shipping product updates and addressing user feedback?</li>
<li>Potential Market Size: How big is the total addressable market for this project? Is it already large, or small but growing rapidly? What will be the impact of this project on the growth rate of their market?</li>
<li>Founder Communication: Are the founders clearly communicating the product vision and capable of growing their product's userbase?</li>
<li>Viability: Is there a scalable and sustainable business to be built around this project? At their core, Colosseum hackathons (as well as Eternal) are startup competitions, so this is critical. Make sure to allocate enough time on your presentation to give a holistic view of your startup.</li>

        answer: `The program includes 1:1 mentorship with the Colosseum team, access to an elite founder community, connections with top developers and VCs in the ecosystem, weekly educational sessions, and an investor Demo Day.

1:1 Mentorship: Colosseum will split up the startups in the batch between our 3 cofounders: Matty, Clay, and Nate. We will be oncall for the teams we are assigned throughout the program, to support and coach on everything from GTM strategy to VC pitches to making intros to anyone who can help accelerate your startup.

Founder Community: Accelerator founders will immediately get access to a private group of current Solana founders and developers. Most of your peers in this group have won previous Solana Hackathons and have gone on to grow their startups to be in the upper echelon of the crypto ecosystem. This group of connections is the best way to become embedded in the Solana ecosystem. See who is already <a class="text-green-1 hover:brightness-150" target="_blank" href="/about#mentor-network">in the group</a>.

Educational Sessions: Each week, leading crypto founders and developers host a comprehensive set of educational sessions to help your startup grow. These mentor group sessions are optional. However, accelerator founders are required to attend weekly group check ins. To accommodate all time zones, the sessions and office hours will usually start at 10am EST.

Demo Day: During the last week of the program, Colosseum will invite 150+ early-stage crypto investors to a private Demo Day where founders have the opportunity to pitch their startups. Each team will have 2 minutes to pitch.`,

      {
        id: "a-faq-4",
        question: "Is the Accelerator in-person or online?",
        answer: `The second and third weeks are in-person in San Francisco, and teams will receive a lodging and food stipend for that component. There is dedicated office space in the Financial District where the program educational sessions and workshops will take place.

The remaining six weeks as well as the demo day will take place online.

Also, Colosseum will occasionally host meetups for current batch members and alumni in various cities globally.`,

        question: "How do I apply to the Accelerator?",
        answer:
          'The only way to be eligible is by signing up for a Colosseum account and submitting a product to <a class="text-green-1 hover:brightness-150" target="_blank" href="/eternal">Eternal</a> or in the next Colosseum hackathon. Winners of the competitions will be offered an opportunity to interview for the Accelerator.',
      },
      {
        id: "a-faq-6",
        question:
          "Why are founders required to first participate in Eternal or the Colosseum Hackathon?",
        answer: `We believe the best founders and early-stage teams in the world can iterate extremely quickly, are technically competent, and are fierce competitors. The Hackathon gives founders globally a level playing field to showcase their potential to build a world-changing startup.

Therefore, we believe winning our hackathon or being selected from Eternal is a much better filter for entrepreneurial talent than a written application, personal connections, or other sourcing mechanisms.`,

        id: "a-faq-8",
        question:
          "Are Colosseum Hackathon winners required to join the Accelerator?",
        answer:
          "No it is not required. However, the program is specifically designed to accelerate serious Solana founders in the earliest stages of launching their products. We invest $250,000 in each startup and provide a comprehensive program that you won’t find anywhere else.",

      {
        id: "a-faq-9",
        question:
          "Are Colosseum Hackathon winners or Eternal applicants guaranteed acceptance into the Accelerator?",
        answer: `No. However, hackathon and Eternal winners are guaranteed an interview with Colosseum's team.

The purpose of the interview is to determine if founders are committed to turning their hackathon project into a full-time startup, among other factors.`,
      },
      {
        id: "a-faq-10",
        question: "How much does the program cost?",
        answer: `Other than travel costs, the program is completely free. Accepted founders will need to book flights to San Francisco for the two in-person weeks of the accelerator program. Colosseum will provide lodging and food stipends for the duration of the two weeks.

 Accelerator admittance requires that Colosseum invests $250K in your startup through our standard deal. We want to continue to support and ensure our organization is aligned with your company over the years to come.

We also require that founders joining the Accelerator put in their best effort to leverage the connections, education, and mentorship received during the program.`,

      {
        id: "a-faq-11",
        question: "How many Accelerator batches are there per year?",

      },
      {
        id: "a-faq-12",
        question: "How many teams are accepted into Accelerator batches?",
        answer:
          "Initially, Colosseum will be accepting up to 15 teams. Over time, we plan to expand the number of teams we can support per batch.",
      },
      {
        id: "a-faq-13",
        question: "What are my chances of being accepted into the program?",
        answer: `There were 1,473 product submissions across the last Colosseum hackathon and Eternal in the first half of 2025, and we accepted 10 winning teams into the Accelerator. So that is roughly a 0.7% acceptance rate.

It’s common for builders to enter multiple hackathons before landing on the right business. It often takes time to iterate to find the right product, with the right cofounder. So even if you aren’t accepted into the program initially, we encourage you to keep exploring the idea maze!`,

        answer: `Our Dropout Program provides ambitious students the opportunity to build full-time on their crypto startup. Admitted students will be automatically accepted into Colosseum's next accelerator cohort and receive an upfront investment of $250,000 in their startup. To be eligible for the prize, students are required to:
<ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6">
<li>Win one of the university prizes in our hackathon</li>
<li>Be willing to drop out or take a leave of absence from their university to commit full-time to their startup</li>
<li>Be under the age of 23 and currently attend a 4-year college</li>
<li>Be interviewed by the Colosseum team to determine eligibility</li></ul>`,
